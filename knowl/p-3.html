<div class="para">Have you ever wondered how computers actually calculate things? Computers can only ever do finitely many steps with finitely many bits of information. The inputs in a calculation are numbers represented by finitely many (decimal or binary) digits, for example <span class="process-math">\(x=0.3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=1.744\text{.}\)</span> You probably learned in primary school how to do long addition or multiplication with pencil and paper, and you could imagine that your computer might follow a similar algorithm and compute <span class="process-math">\(x+y = 2.044\)</span> in a finite number of steps. But then how does it calculate <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\sin(x)\text{,}\)</span> or other non-polynomial functions?</div>
