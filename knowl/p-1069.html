<div class="para">We know that a linear equation in two variables can be interpreted as the equation of a line in the plane. For example the equation</div>

\begin{equation*}
2x+3y=6

<div class="para">can be interpreted as a line of slope <span class="process-math">\(-\frac{2}{3}\)</span> and with a <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept of <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> Thus, for a system of linear equations involving two variables each row can be interpreted as a line in the plane and finding the solution to this system can be thought of as finding all of those points in the plane (if any) that lie on all of the lines. (We had several examples last week where we interpreted systems involving just two linear equations this way.)</div>
