<div class="para">For functions of one variable we derived the Taylor series by trying to find a power series in <span class="process-math">\((x-a)\)</span> that matched the function and all its derivatives at <span class="process-math">\(x=a\text{.}\)</span> For functions of two variables we can use a similar idea to derive the Taylor series about the point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)=(a,b)\text{.}\)</span> This series will be a power series in <span class="process-math">\((x-a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((y-b)\)</span> that matches the function and its partial derivatives at the point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)=(a,b)\text{.}\)</span> The formula for the Taylor series of two variables is quite lengthy to write and so we will not reproduce it here. However, as with functions of one variable truncations of this series are called Taylor polynomials and the Taylor polynomial of degree 1 is the linearisation of the function. Similarly, the Taylor polynomial of degree 2 will give us a quadratic approximation to the function.</div>
